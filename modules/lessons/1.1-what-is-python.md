## 📖 What is Python?

Python is a **programming language**. Think of it as a way to give instructions to your computer. Just like you might give directions to a friend ("turn left, walk 100 meters, turn right"), you give instructions to a computer using Python code.

Here's the beautiful thing about Python: it was designed to be **easy to read and write**. The creator, Guido van Rossum, wanted a language that felt almost like writing English.

Let's look at an example:

```python
# Python code to check if a number is positive
number = 10

if number > 0:
    print("This number is positive")
```
Even if you've never programmed before, you can probably guess what this code does. That's the beauty of Python!

## 🐍 A Brief History
| Year	| Event |
|-------|-------|
| 1989	| Guido van Rossum starts working on Python as a hobby project |
| 1991	| Python 0.9.0 released to the public |
| 2000	| Python 2.0 released with new features like list comprehensions |
| 2008	| Python 3.0 released (major update, not backward compatible) |
| 2020	| Python 2 officially retired |
| Today	| Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world |
Fun Fact: Python is named after the British comedy group "Monty Python," not the snake! 🎭

## 🤔 Why Python for Data Science and AI?

Great question! Let's break this down:

### 1. Easy to Learn and Read

Compare these two code snippets that do the same thing:

Python:

```Python

print("Hello, Data Scientist!")
```
Java:

```Java

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Data Scientist!");
    }
}
```
See the difference? Python is clean and simple.

### 2. Powerful Libraries

Python has thousands of pre-built tools (called libraries) for data science:
